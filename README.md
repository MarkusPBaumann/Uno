# Uno
Java based Uno with GUI

![](unoGif.gif)


A simple Java implementation of the classic game of Uno! The core of the project consists of a few major classes, the card the deck and game classes. With these classes we can make object representations of Uno cards and the kind of actions we can take in a game. For example, we can use our game class to "draw a card" and then modify a deck object based on this action. 

The GUI portion of the project consists of a menu, a screen to add players, a screen to change the color of our current playable color with the use of a wild card, and a mainstage. These classes and JFrames work in tandem to visually represent Uno game objects, displaying the current players hand, the players name, the deck, the discard pile which displays the last card played. 

This project was an exercise in developing java classes and how we can use Java objects to represent real life objects and ideas. Next step in the development of this project is to implement a simple AI
